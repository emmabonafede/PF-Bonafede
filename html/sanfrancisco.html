                        <p class="justify">San Francisco, in Northern California, is a mountainous city at the tip of a peninsula surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. It is famous for its year-round mist, the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars, and colorful Victorian houses. The Transamerica Pyramid of the Financial District is the most characteristic skyscraper. In the bay, Alcatraz Island is located, site of the famous old prison.</p>
                        <p class="justify">San Francisco is filled with places that'll give you breathtaking views, incredible stories and a lot of history that lies within. From the painted ladies to The Castro Neighborhood, this bay would offer you endlessly points of interest throughout the entire city. In the Pacific Ocean, you can find Alcatraz. The federal prison on Alcatraz Island in the chilly waters of California’s San Francisco Bay housed some of America’s most difficult and dangerous felons during its years of operation from 1934 to 1963. Among those who served time at the maximum-security facility were the notorious gangster Al “Scarface” Capone (1899-1947) and murderer Robert “Birdman of Alcatraz” Stroud (1890-1963).</p>

          No inmate ever successfully escaped The Rock, as the prison was nicknamed, although more than a dozen known attempts were made over the years. After the prison was shut down due to high operating costs, the island was occupied for almost two years, starting in 1969, by a group of Native-American activists. Today, historic Alcatraz Island, which was also the site of a U.S. military prison from the late 1850s to 1933, is a popular tourist destination. -- In the pictures below, you can see pictures of me downtown, with my friend Paula and by myself at Alcatraz Island!
